The user will have two dropdown menus.
In the dropdown menus, there will exist a list of health traits.
Each trait will have an associated numerical data.
When the user selects the traits they wish to relate, they will hit 'run'.
A x vs y scatter plot will appear with an R2 value. 
Therefore, the user can 'discover' relationships in health data simply by selecting the traits as listed in a database.
Then, a 'restart' button will reset the program.
