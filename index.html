    <h1>Project Moonstone</h1>
    <h2>Uncover hidden relationshps in health data</h2>
    <p>The 21st buzzwords of IoT and big-data are used so often and interchangably the average person tends to forget they're actual things that can help society.
    While their applications span across any-and-all industries (both technical and humanitarian), one
    area that excites me especially is Mobile Health, wearable technology, and remote patient monitoring (See the Health Data wiki page). All three of these areas have one thing in common: they create patient data.
    In this demonstration, witness first-hand how large sets of health metrics can help researchers glean insights about health trends and relationships.</p>

    <p>Here's the sitch: you're the reseacher. Pick two health metrics below and discover any potential relationships among them.
    The program will access HealthData.gov's Database, gather the data, and display it for you in a nice little plot. See if you can uncover any hidden relationships!
    (Hint: The higher the R<sup>2</sup> value, the more related the two variables are!)</p>

    <h3>Project Workflow</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Write SQL (the most popular RDBMS) to access a health database.</li>
      <li>Display dropdown list of potential traits that the user can select</li>
      <li>Record users selection of two traits, upon them running the search</li>
        <ol>
          <li>You can mix-and-match databases, to provide more variety and freedom in your analysis</li>
        </ol>
      <li>Write SQL to gather and store the list</li>
			<li>Write Python (Django or Flask) to parse through the numbers</li>
			<li>Display the relationship in a graph, State the R^2 Value</li>
		</ol>


    <h4>Step One: Accessing and querying a healthcare database</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Database must contain a ton of quantifiable quantifiable health metrics.</li>
        <li><a href="https://medium.com/@ODSC/15-open-datasets-for-healthcare-830b19980d9">Article with examples</a></li>
        <li>MIMIC-III is part of PhysioNet.org - a website dedicated to physiological data science projects.</li>
        <li><a href="https://archive.physionet.org/physiobank/database/mimic2cdb-ps/">MIMIC-II</a> is a public Data Set with 110 patient entries.</li>
        <li>PhysioNet's open datasets may allow the user to access one or many comparisons across many databases. When running their analysis.</li>
      </ol>
    <h4>Design the UI of the site? So people will know how it works?</h4>
